Data Structures - Binary Search Tree

____________

For this project we have to build a binary search tree, it reads text from a a file and depending on the character it will either load, insert, delete, find, or print. 

For this program I used c++, I had trouble with the comparison operators, the only way I was able to get was compare within the function. I had a memory leak if I didnâ€™t do it that way. You can insert the address of the file in main and it will read it in. 

I had a lot of memory leak problems with this project, it took a lot of debugging to make everything work. It worked perfectly with my own text file, it was when I used the text file included with the project when I ran in to issues. Everything is finally working.
